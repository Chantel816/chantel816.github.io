    My name is Chantel Ma. Currently I am pursuing a secondary bachalor's in computer science at Florida Atlantic University. My first degree was in International Affairs with a double major in Chinese and I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. I am a huge fan of board games/Table top games, but I only play for fun, not to compete. My first love is always in Travel and Food advatures.
